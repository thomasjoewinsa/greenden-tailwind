# greenden-tailwind
I have created a webpage for the GreenDen website using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. This project is a clean and responsive landing page designed to highlight eco-friendly and plant-related content. I used Tailwind CSS to efficiently style the components with utility-first classes, making the design process faster and more consistent. The webpage demonstrates my front-end development skills and reflects a modern, minimalistic aesthetic.
